 Analysis of trends in hotel prices in selected European Cities
 
Are you a frequent traveler who often ponders if pricier hotels necessarily offer guests better quality services? If yes, you are not alone!

Partly motivated by curiosity to answer this very question, this project web-scrapped prices and attributes data for 6500 hotels across twelve popular European cities, and analyses/visualizes the scraped data to determine whether certain hypothesized factors affect hotel prices across these cities.

This informative project is a product of responsible web-scrapping, data manipulation, and exciting story-telling.
